For Progress 2, we have developed some of these core pages and their sub-components that define our MVP.\\n\\n## Tech Stack\\n\\n### TypeScript\\nWe chose React with TypeScript for this phase. TypeScript offers type safety, is an industry standard, and all Trekkers members have experience working with it.\\n\\n### Tailwind CSS\\nWe integrated Tailwind CSS for easier and faster development of styled components. Justin Lieu has led the team in implementing Tailwind during the development process.\\n\\n### Mantine UI\\nWe also utilized Mantine, a popular React UI Component library. After comparing MUI, Chakra, and Mantine, we chose Mantine for its diverse components and ease of customization.\\n\\n## Key Pages and Features\\n\\n### Landing Page\\n\\n![Landing Page 1](/img/wip-2/landing-page-1.png)\\n![Landing Page 2](/img/wip-2/landing-page-2.png)\\n![Responsive 2](/img/wip-2/responsive-2.png)\\n![Profile Dropdown](/img/wip-2/profile-dropdown.png)\\n\\nOur landing page provides a brief description of the application, includes short card components related to travel, and features a newsletter signup.\\n\\n### Profile Page\\n\\n![Profile Page](/img/wip-2/profile-page.png)\\n![Small Trip Cards](/img/wip-2/small-trip-cards.png)\\n![Large Trip Cards](/img/wip-2/large-trip-cards.png)\\n\\nAs mentioned in Progress 1, the profile page displays all trips associated with a user, allowing them to browse through their trips conveniently.\\n\\n### Trip Planning Page\\n\\nThe Trip Planning page is one of the main features of our application, consisting of four subpages: Overview, Details, Map, and Timeline.\\n\\n![Map](/img/wip-2/map.png)\\n![To-do List](/img/wip-2/to-do-list.png)\\n![Trip Details](/img/wip-2/trip-details.png)\\n\\n\\n### Settings Page\\n\\n![Account Settings](/img/wip-2/account-settings.png)\\n![Responsive 1](/img/wip-2/responsive-1.png)\\n![Profile Settings](/img/wip-2/profile-settings.png)\\n\\nThe Settings page includes Account Settings and Public Profile Settings, enabling users to manage their profiles and account preferences.\\n\\nStay tuned for more updates as we continue to refine and enhance Trek!"}]}}')}}]);
