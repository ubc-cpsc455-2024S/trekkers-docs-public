# Terms of Reference

Group 4: Trekkers is a dedicated team of five students from the University of British Columbia, enrolled in CPSC 455. The team members, Jacob Zhu, Justin Lieu, Kevin Xu, Matthew Kang, and William Xiao, are under the guidance of instructors Ian McLean and Firas Moosvi, with Justin Jao serving as their teaching assistant for Workshop Cluster 1.
Driven by a shared enthusiasm for exploring new technologies in the ever-evolving tech landscape, we are thrilled to introduce Trek—an intuitive and personalized trip-planner designed to cater to travelers of all kinds. Trek harnesses the power of cutting-edge ML/AI technologies to offer personalized trip recommendations, coupled with a user-friendly interface that simplifies and enhances the trip-planning experience.
While the CPSC 455 course project is intended as a beginner-level software development exercise, our team is committed to designing Trek as a scalable, industry-grade product with a strong emphasis on compliance and user-centric design. Our approach ensures that, even as a student project, Trek meets high standards of quality and functionality, providing a robust foundation for future development and deployment.

## Project Information

### Product Deliverables
The deliverable will be under one website that contains multiple key interfaces including the following:


**Interface to View User’s Profile with Associated Trips** - This interface includes a user’s public profile, a public about me section, basic public statistics and information about the user, and lists of trips that the user is associated with (user created or user is participating or participated in) the trip.


**Interface to View/Create/Remove/Modify a User’s Trip** - This interface includes the user’s trip, add/delete/modify new itinerary for a trip, manage budget, and view the overall summary of a trip.

**Interface to Communicate with a Chat Bot to Modify a User’s Trip** - This interface exists within the interface to View/Create/Remove/Modify a user’s trip. It is a popup chatbot interface, where the user can request the Chat Bot to create changes or suggest information regarding the trip.

**Interface to Manage User’s Information** - This interface allows the user to view and manage the user’s private information.

### High-Level Project Description

The high-level initial project description is written as below:


> Have you ever tried to plan a group trip with your friends, but it never "made it out of the group chat"? Then this web app is perfect for you! Trek provides a centralized place to do all of your trip planning - say goodbye to Google Docs! Once you log in, Trek allows you to design your ideal trip, with trip destinations, timeframes, accommodations, and more. Then save the trip and let Trek easily let you share your trips with a single click. Trek can intelligently recommend the best things to do by using API calls to sites like Tripadvisor to get up-to-date ratings on good places to visit, as well as through other Trek users' most popular destinations. Trek can also display everything on an interactive map to help you visualize your transportation planning! Trek might also be able to give your groups weather information, a full itinerary written up by an LLM, and even specific transportation options with their costs.

### Out of Scope

Although we are building Trek to be an industry-level software, given the limitations in timeline, we are unable to design this product to include software/system administrators and analysts in our user base, and not be able to include an administrative interface for managing the software.
As an alternative, thorough documentation will be provided with the release of version 1.0.0 that outlines how administrators and analysts can extract key metrics and manage the app from the backend, as well as deployment and troubleshooting guides.

### Constraints 

As a student-led project without a sponsor, Trek has strict budget constraints that must be followed. Currently, our budget is set to be a total of $100. Utilising ML/AI technologies with external APIs can build-up costs. Due to this budget constraint, this project will introduce an API rate limit to minimise costs.

### Assumptions

Our usability assumptions are based on the typical operating environment for the solution. This web-based application is designed for use on various devices, including desktop and laptop computers, tablets, and mobile devices. It is optimized to function seamlessly on major and up-to-date web browsers, such as Chrome, Safari, Edge, and Firefox.

We assume the system will handle real-life production use without any load limitations. It is engineered to support up to 150 concurrent users, reflecting the class size of CPSC 455. The system's stateless design ensures efficient management, ease of implementation, and scalability while delivering a streamlined and responsive user experience.

### Dependencies 

Dependencies for this project include access to OpenAI and Google’s API, which is crucial for personalisation and usability, along with various other functionalities. Funding for this dependency will be $20 per team member, with a total of $100 per member.

## Development Roadmap

### Development Phase Plan

The development of Trek will happen in the phases mentioned below. The development phases are distinct from the deadlines and course schedule of CPSC 455, and not necessarily aligned with it.

## Team Structure 

Unlike most software development teams, our team does not have an explicit leadership role including project manager, front-end lead, back-end lead. All members are expected to show leadership in their areas of knowledge and interests, and all members are expected to be a full-stack developer. Much of the traditional project manager roles, such as maintaining development phases and deadlines belong to the documentation experts.

### Experts 

One of the strengths of our team is the diversity in knowledge and the shared goal to learn from one another. Instead of having lead roles, we have designated team ‘experts’ that act as a point of contact when a member is having difficulties during a development process. Members are encouraged to ping an expert on the slack channel when they require assistance or guidance. Our experts have a responsibility that all team members are able to produce high quality code and understand the code they produce.

| Area of Expertise | Experts               |
|-------------------|------------------------|
| Web Design        | Justin Lieu, Matthew Kang |
| React             | Justin Lieu, Matthew Kang |
| Redux             | Justin Lieu            |
| Auth0             | Matthew Kang           |
| API Design        | William Xiao, Matthew Kang |
| NodeJS            | Jacob Zhu              |
| Express           | William Xiao, Jacob Zhu |
| MongoDB           | TBA                    |
| Documentation     | William Xiao, Matthew Kang |

The list of experts will be updated throughout the project. 


### Communications Plan

Our team’s availability is managed through a private When2Meet link shared on our Slack channel. Team members are expected to keep their availability updated throughout the project’s duration. All asynchronous communication for project needs will be conducted in the team’s slack channel.

We have established four types of synchronous team meetings:

#### Weekly Team Meetings
Held every Sunday from 10:00 a.m. to 11:00 a.m. on Zoom, these meetings provide an opportunity for all team members to brainstorm ideas, discuss progress, address blockers, re-evaluate milestone deadlines, and identify and mitigate project risks. Additional team meetings may be scheduled as needed.

#### Feature Meetings
These smaller meetings focus on a specific feature or group of features (sprints) to be developed. They can be scheduled at any time by two or more members using our shared availability on When2Meet.

#### Bi-Weekly TA Design/Code Reviews
Occurring every other Saturday workshop from 12:30 p.m. to 3:30 p.m., these reviews are dedicated to assessing current progress, obtaining feedback from TAs or other CPSC 455 teams, addressing blockers and risks, and ensuring the project stays on track.

#### Lab Meetings
Taking place during registered lab times on Thursdays between 5:00 p.m. and 7:00 p.m., these quick meetings serve to provide brief updates between weekly meetings. Note that Matthew Kang will not be present for these lab meetings.
