# Demo Access

There are two interfaces that are availble for demo: Trek, and Trek Admin Panel. 

Anyone is able to visit and create their own account (OAuth 2.0 with GDPR and CCPA Compliance) with Trek, or the course staff can use the credentials provided by us.

On the other hand, the Trek Admin Panel is unavailable for open public access. Credentials are provided for the course staff or other authorized users only.
