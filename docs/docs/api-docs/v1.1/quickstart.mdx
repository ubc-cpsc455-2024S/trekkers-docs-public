# Quickstart

## Getting Started
Welcome to the Trekkers API! Our API is designed to be flexible, easy-to-use, and secure.

Our goals while designing the API were the following:
- Cover all of the minimal, standard, and stretch goals
  - While all stretch goals will have appropriate documentation and endpoints to support their functionality, not all of
   their endpoints may be implemented.
- Have endpoints that correspond to functionality on every frontend page of Trek so far
- Follow best practices for API design, including documentation, testing, and standards as documented by the relevant RFCs

The API is a REST API, which means accessing the API is done entirely through HTTP requests to our backend
server. Our API has endpoints that implement the following verbs:
- **GET**: used to read a resource from our server
- **PUT**: used to create or update a resource
- **POST**: used to add new data (like trips)
- **DELETE**: used to delete a resource from the server

To learn more about how to make requests to a REST API, we recommend *[this tutorial](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-fetch-data-from-an-api-using-the-fetch-api-in-javascript/)*.
During development, our REST API is hosted at http://localhost:3000/api/v1.

The URI for the API is /api/v1, which will be incremented on any release updates. To avoid the API version
incrementing too quickly, our development philosophy is to make fewer but larger API changes.

The release of the next API version will deprecate all prior API versions, but the prior API versions will remain
available for one year after its deprecation.

Note: while Trek is under heavy development, lots of the API will be quite verbose in logging. However, for security reasons, the production
API will not give out as much debugging information directly to the caller of the API.

### Authentication
Many of the endpoints of Trek will not be accessible without authenticating a request.

At the moment, the authentication method will be Auth0 implementing OAuth2. Auth0 is preferred as it has an
implementation of OAuth2 already, in addition to support for protecting against attacks such as cross-site request forgery.

Documentation is available at https://auth0.com/docs/api/authentication and https://oauth.net/2/. Requests that require
authentication will require a “Authorization: Bearer” token in the request’s header resulting from a successful OAuth
client-server token exchange.

### Supported Datatypes
At the moment, the only proposed supported datatype is JSON. JSON is one of the most popular formats and is very
compatible with JavaScript.

All dates are stored in **[Unix Epoch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_time)** time.
