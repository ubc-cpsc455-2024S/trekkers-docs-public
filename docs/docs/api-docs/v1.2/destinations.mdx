- Show city/town specific transportation options/cost


## Search for a destination
`GET /api/v1/destination`

Find destinations within a certain radius and/or in a city.

If the `city` URL param is specified, only search results that are in that city will be returned.

If `lat`, `lon` are specified, then the search will be within a circular radius of that location.
Note that **both** lat and lon are required together (i.e. queries with only lat or only lon will be rejected).

| `lat`  | Latitude of location (optional) |
