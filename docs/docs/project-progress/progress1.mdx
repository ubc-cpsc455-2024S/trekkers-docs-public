## Questions & Answers
- **Q**: Are you worried about AI hallucinations?
  - **Trek**: Yes, this a very much a possibility. However, our intended use
    for our AI integrations are to never have them be for unreviewed content.
    We are also thinking about having a flagging system to help our AI make
    better decisions.
- **Q**: Have you thought about any integrations with any Maps? Having places
  saved/pinned/flagged on Google Maps for example may be a helpful feature.
  - **Trek**: Yes absolutely! This is one of our stretch goals and was part
  of our original thoughts about the design of the project, but just in case
  we kept it as a stretch item in case it turns out to be difficult to
  implement.\
  Google Maps also has a feature where you can input a list of locations and
  it generates the list of points on a map, which we might use too!
