## Slides

In this progress we received some feedback about our slides taking a significant portion of our presentation time. In future progress reports, we plan to spend less time on the slides and more time on demoing our app.

## Questions & Answers
- **Q**: What issues did you run into during this progress?
  - **Trek**: We found some more bugs during this progress from the original frontend that slowed down our timelines a little bit.\
  The Redux + API coordination was also difficult as we were having others update the UI at the same time as the Redux and API were being designed. Hence, coordinating that turned out to be hard.

- **Q**: What is the techstack used for Trek?
  - **Trek**: Please see our [blogpost](/blog/wip-2).
- **Q**: Have you considered how many endpoints you need? It looks like you will need a lot for the app.
  - **Trek**: Yes we have! See our [API documentation](/docs/category/version-11) for more details.
- **Q**: Does your group have experience with Redux? How did you find the learning curve? What resources did you use to help you learn the technology?
  - **Trek**: None of us on the Trek team have used Redux before this project. Most of our learning was done through the CPSC 455 workshops and by reading documentation. We found that the documentation was quite thorough, and understanding the Redux workflow before writing the code is crucial in our project philosophy.
- **Q**: Other than user information, will you be storing any other info? Such as their past treks, etc.
  - **Trek**: Currently, we are storing Trips, Users, and Destinations, which is provided in our API documentation. Our high-level data design on Trips/Users/Destinations allows extensibility and assigns attributes or related data on these 3 schemas/data. For example, we will allow users to add photos, notes, and other attributes associated with the Trip.\
  We may also add some data storage as necessary for any AI needs.
- **Q**: How have you done your testing and CI/CD so far?
  - **Trek**: We don't have a testing framework yet, but that's coming soon in the upcoming sprints. Our CI at the moment is building each project branch and project feature branch, and we are also working on a CD to deploy automatically if someone has pushed to a development branch.
- **Q**: What plans do you have for your AI/LLM integration stretch goal?
  - **Trek**: One of the features we plan to integrate is having a trip itinerary thatâ€™s generated based on the trip details and information provided. Another feature would be recommendations based on user preferences/past experiences, think recommended landmarks, restaurants, hidden gems to visit, and also new countries/cities to visit.\
  Due to time constrraints, it is still unclear how much we will be able to accomplish on this front.
