# Version 0.2.0 - Release Notes

## General Notes:

In version 0.2.0, we have added Redux, APIs, and basic CRUD for user information.


## Redux

## API Development
- We have released the documentation for [API version 1.1](https://ubc-cpsc455-2024s.github.io/trekkers-docs-public/docs/api-docs/v1.1/quickstart)
- It is now possible to build and start a Trek backend server. All of the endpoints in API v1.1 are present under the /api/v1 path.

## User Information

## Misc. Frontend Changes
- Added the Timeline, Experience, and Trip Overview pages
- The Maps page on a trip has been updated - all information is now in tabs to make the page more responsive.

## Known Issues:
- Many components of the trip application are not connected to the API, nor have Redux. This will be hooked-up and/or implemented soon.
