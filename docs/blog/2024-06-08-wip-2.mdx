All members of Trekkers are thrilled to share our second work-in-progress update and introduce the first pre-release (v0.1.0) of Trek.

In **Progress 2**, we have finalized our app structure, including the high-level React component structure, and developed front-end interfaces for the main features of our minimal viable product (MVP).

### High-Level Overview

The pages of our web application are categorized into three main groups:
- **Main Pages**: Landing Page, Public Profile Page, etc.
- **Trip App Pages**: Overview, Details, Analytics Pages
- **Settings Pages**: User Profile/Account Settings Page

Each of these pages consists of various sub-components. For Progress 2, we have developed some of these core pages and their sub-components that define our MVP.

## Tech Stack

### TypeScript
We chose React with TypeScript for this phase. TypeScript offers type safety, is an industry standard, and all Trekkers members have experience working with it.

### Tailwind CSS
We integrated Tailwind CSS for easier and faster development of styled components. Justin Lieu has led the team in implementing Tailwind during the development process.

### Mantine UI
We also utilized Mantine, a popular React UI Component library. After comparing MUI, Chakra, and Mantine, we chose Mantine for its diverse components and ease of customization.

## Key Pages and Features

### Landing Page

As mentioned in Progress 1, the profile page displays all trips associated with a user, allowing them to browse through their trips conveniently.

### Trip Planning Page

The Trip Planning page is one of the main features of our application, consisting of four subpages: Overview, Details, Map, and Timeline.
