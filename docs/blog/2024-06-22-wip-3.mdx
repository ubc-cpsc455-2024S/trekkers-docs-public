All members of Trekkers are thrilled to share our third work-in-progress update for Trek.

In **Progress 3**, we have added Redux to Trek, by thinking of the main type of data we will be storing and about how we would like this data to be “connected” to our components.

## Redux

### Action #1: ___

### Action #2: ____

### Action #3: ___

## Other Goals

Stay tuned for more updates as we continue to refine and enhance Trek!
